Summary:
- This project is a 'the Lord of the Rings' fan-site with character and movie info

Questions:

What worked well?
- What went the smoothest was probably the use of react-router-dom. Setting up routes and links went
pretty well. Using the Lord of the Rings API also went well.

What didn't work well?
- I had to fight with the movie api quite a bit. It was a struggle.
