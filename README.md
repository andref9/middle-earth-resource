Summary:
- This project is a 'the Lord of the Rings' fan-site with character and movie info

Questions:

What worked well?
- What went the smoothest was probably the use of react-router-dom. Setting up routes and links went
pretty well. Using the Lord of the Rings API also went well.

What didn't work well?
- I had to fight with the movie api quite a bit. It was a struggle. I also fought css.

What changes would you make to this project?
- I would try to style it more. I might add some search functionality to the project as well.

What would you improve and/or add to this project?
- I would maybe add a search bar in the character index page. I should definitely improve the styling at a later date... after watching some CSS videos on YouTube... I could add other pages as well.
